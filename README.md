## DAY 1 - Drum Kit.

In this exercise, I had to do a drum kit, a fun play where you can hit a key on your keyboard and then, for each key, we will listen a different sound and see an animation where it pops the button up to be a little bigger with a yellow border. 

## DAY 2 - JS Clock

In this exercise, I created a clock using CSS an JavaScript.
